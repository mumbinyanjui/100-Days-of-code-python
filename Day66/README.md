# Day 66 — Building Your Own API with RESTful Routing

## 📝 Overview  
On Day 66, you transition deeper into backend web development by **creating your own API**. You’ll learn **RESTful routing principles** and how to structure endpoints that align with HTTP methods. The project typically builds on the **“Cafe & Wifi”** concept from previous days. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🎯 Goals & Deliverables  
- Design and implement a **RESTful API** for the “Cafe & Wifi” dataset.  
- Define proper **CRUD endpoints** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using routes that follow REST conventions (e.g. `GET /cafes`, `POST /cafes`, `PATCH /cafes/<id>`, `DELETE /cafes/<id>`).  
- Use JSON for request payloads and responses.  
- Include **error handling** for invalid requests (e.g. missing fields, invalid IDs).  
- Document the API endpoints, e.g. via **Postman collection** or a readme section. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Flask (or Flask-RESTful / Flask framework)**  
- Python libraries such as `flask`, `flask_sqlalchemy`, `flask_marshmallow` (or similar for serialization)  
- JSON for data interchange  
- Postman or similar to test API endpoints  
- Possibly SQLite or an in-memory database for persistence

## ✅ Tips & Best Practices  
- Plan your **routes** before coding — map out which HTTP methods correspond to which CRUD actions.  
- Use **blueprints or modular structure** if your app grows.  
- Validate incoming data (e.g. type checks, required fields) before processing.  
- Return proper **HTTP status codes** (e.g. 200, 201, 400, 404, 500).  
- Write concise **API documentation** so others know how to use your endpoints.  
- Test endpoints manually (via Postman) and consider writing **automated API tests**.

## 🧩 How It Fits in the Course Flow  
- Day 66 builds on previous Flask and web design days (Days 60-65) by introducing **backend API architecture**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- It sets the foundation for later lessons where you’ll integrate front-end and API, handle authentication, and embed more complex features.
