# Day 55 â€“ Flask Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Todayâ€™s project was to build a **Number Guessing Game** using **Flask** and decorators.  
When a user visits the site and guesses a number in the URL (e.g., `/5`), the app compares it with a random number between 1 and 9 and returns feedback with fun GIFs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn how to create simple Flask routes.
- Use **decorators** to validate and enhance functionality.
- Return HTML responses dynamically.
- Use **GIFs** to make the UI engaging.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Random number generation on each request.
- Validation logic to check whether the guessed number is too low, too high, or correct.
- Decorator to wrap route logic with feedback functionality.
- Fun Giphy animations for feedback.
