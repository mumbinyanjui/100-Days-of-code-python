# üçï Day 3: Python Pizza Deliveries ‚Äì 100 Days of Code

Welcome to **Day 3** of the **100 Days of Code** challenge!

This simple Python script simulates a pizza ordering system where users choose their pizza size, whether they want pepperoni, and if they want extra cheese. The total cost is calculated based on these choices.

---

## üß† Concepts Practiced

- User input with `input()`
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditionals
- Arithmetic operations
- Formatted strings (`f-strings`)

---

## üíª Project Overview

The user is asked:

1. **What size pizza** they want:  
   `S` for Small, `M` for Medium, or `L` for Large

2. **If they want pepperoni**:  
   `Y` for Yes, `N` for No

3. **If they want extra cheese**:  
   `Y` for Yes, `N` for No

Based on the inputs, the program calculates the total bill.
