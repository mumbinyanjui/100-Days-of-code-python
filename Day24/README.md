\# ðŸ“¬ Day 24 â€“ Mail Merge Project (Automating Letters)



\## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned:

\- How to use `open()` and `with` for file reading and writing

\- The difference between \*\*relative and absolute paths\*\*

\- Using `.read()`, `.replace()`, and `.strip()` to clean and manipulate file content

\- Automating output by generating multiple files with loop logic



\## ðŸ§ª Mini Project:

Load a list of names and a letter template, replace the \[name] placeholder in the template, and output a personalized letter for each person.



ðŸ“‚ NOTE: This project \*\*relies on the local file paths from the course materials\*\* (names and templates), not from my own code structure.



\## ðŸ§  Key Takeaway:

This was an intro to real-world automation. Understanding how Python interacts with your file system is crucial in data handling and batch processing.
