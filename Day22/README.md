## ✅ Topics Covered:

- Real-time game programming with \*\*turtle\*\*

- Handling multiple moving objects (ball and paddles)

- Keyboard input for player controls (`onkey()`)

- Collision detection with walls and paddles

- Score tracking and display using the scoreboard



## 🎮 Mini Project: Pong Game

A complete two-player Pong-style game using Turtle.  

- Player 1 controls the left paddle (e.g., “W” and “S” keys)  

- Player 2 controls the right paddle (e.g., “Up” and “Down” keys)  

- Ball bounces off walls and paddles  

- The first player to reach 10 points \*\*wins\*\*, with real-time score display



## 🧠 Key Takeaways:

- Managing multiple Turtle objects and coordinating their movement  

- Implementing game loops, screen refresh, and delay control  

- Handling collision logic for dynamic gameplay  

- Clean modular design using classes for paddles, ball, and scoreboard
