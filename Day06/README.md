# 🧩 Day 6 – Maze Challenge with Functions and While Loops (Reeborg's World)

## ✅ What I Learned
- Writing and organizing code using **functions**
- Using **while loops** for repetition and decision-making
- Practicing control flow logic to navigate a maze

## 🌍 Platform
We used **[Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)** to write Python code that guides Reeborg through a maze.

## 🔄 Concepts Practiced
- `def` to create helper functions
- `while not at_goal():` to keep looping
- Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Custom logic to turn right or check walls

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Using functions and loops together enables problem-solving for complex paths like mazes. Reeborg helps visualize how decisions and loops work in real-time.
