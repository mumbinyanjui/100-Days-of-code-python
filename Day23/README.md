# 🐢 Day 23 – Turtle Crossing Game



## 🎯 What I Learned:

- Object-oriented design using custom classes (`Player`, `CarManager`, `Scoreboard`)

- Handling screen animation with `screen.update()` and `time.sleep()`

- Detecting collision using coordinates

- Key press detection with `onkey()` and `listen()`

- Increasing difficulty by increasing car speed on each level



## 🕹️ Project Overview:

I built a mini Turtle Crossing game where a player (a turtle) must cross a street filled with moving cars. When it reaches the top, the level increases and so does the difficulty.



## 🧠 Key Takeaway:
 This was the most advanced use of `turtle` graphics yet. The structured use of OOP really helped organize the project cleanly and made it easier to expand.



## 📌 Next Steps:

- Add a high score tracker

- Add lives or difficulty settings
