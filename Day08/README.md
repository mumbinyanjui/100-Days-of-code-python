# 🛡️ Day 8 – Caesar Cipher Project

Today’s lesson explored how to build a **Caesar Cipher**, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters by a certain amount in the alphabet.

## ✅ What I Learned:
- How to define and use **functions**
- Working with **loops** and **conditional logic**
- Handling **string indexing and manipulation**
- Creating **user-friendly menus** for repeated actions

## 🔐 Mini Project: Caesar Cipher
This simple tool allows users to **encrypt** or **decrypt** messages by shifting the alphabet letters by a custom number.

### 🧠 Key Concepts:
- Use of `ord()` and `chr()` to shift letters
- Looping back around the alphabet
- Function reuse for encoding and decoding
- Handling edge cases and keeping the cipher continuous
