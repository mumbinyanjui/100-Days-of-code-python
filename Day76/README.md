# Day 76 ‚Äî Interactive Dashboards & Advanced Visual Analytics

## üéØ Aim

On Day 76, the focus is to take your visualizations further by making them interactive and dashboard-ready. You will integrate multiple plots, controls (filters, dropdowns), and possibly connect to a dataset dynamically to allow user exploration.

## üìö Topics Covered

- Building dashboards (e.g. with Plotly Dash, Streamlit, Panel)  
- Combining multiple visualizations and coordinating interactions  
- Linking user input (filters, slider, dropdown) to updates in graphs  
- Using callbacks or reactive programming to update outputs  
- Layout design: arranging charts, controls, and narrative text  
- Performance considerations (e.g. limiting data, caching)  
- Exporting or deploying dashboards  

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries

- `plotly` (Express + Graph Objects)  
- `Dash` or `Streamlit` (or similar dashboarding framework)  
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- (Optional) `numpy`, `json`, `pickle` for data handling  
- (Optional) caching or memoization patterns  

## üìù Suggested Workflow / Steps

1. **Choose or prepare a dataset**  
   Select or load a dataset that has multiple dimensions (e.g. time, category, numeric metrics) so you can slice and filter.

2. **Preprocess the data**  
   Clean, filter, aggregate, and structure it in a way that is efficient for reactive filtering (e.g. precompute groupby, reduce size).

3. **Design UI controls**  
   Decide which filters or selectors you‚Äôll allow (e.g. date range slider, category dropdown, checkbox for metrics).

4. **Build individual plots**  
   Write functions that take the filtered data as input and return Plotly figures (e.g. line charts, bar charts, scatter plots).

5. **Set up callbacks / interactivity**  
   In Dash, define `@app.callback` functions; in Streamlit, use stateful widgets to recompute. Link UI controls to update the visualizations.

6. **Compose layout**  
   Assemble the controls and charts in a dashboard layout (sidebar, header, main content). Add titles, explanatory text, and styling.

7. **Optimize and polish**  
   - Use caching or limit data to maintain performance  
   - Format axes, legends, tooltips  
   - Add hover info, annotations, or instructions  
   - Make the layout responsive  

8. **Deploy / share (optional)**  
   - Export the dashboard to HTML  
   - Deploy on a platform (Heroku, Streamlit Cloud, Dash Enterprise)  
   - Provide instructions for running locally
