# 🔐 Day 5 – Password Generator

## ✅ What I Learned
- `for` loops for iteration
- The `range()` function
- Combining strings and characters to build outputs
- Basic string manipulation

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Looping through ranges to generate characters
- Random character selection
- Building secure, randomized passwords

## 💡 Mini Project: Password Generator
This project creates a random password based on user input. It asks how many letters, symbols, and numbers the user wants in the password and then uses loops and `random.choice()` to assemble it.
