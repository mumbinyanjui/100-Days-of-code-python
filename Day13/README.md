# 🐞 Day 13 – Debugging in Python

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Understanding common **error types**: Syntax, Indentation, Name, Type, Index errors, etc.
- How to read and interpret **tracebacks**
- Using **print statements** for step-by-step tracing
- Strategies for debugging: 
  - Rubber duck debugging 🦆
  - Breaking down code into smaller parts
  - Commenting and uncommenting blocks to isolate bugs
  - Using `print()` to check variable states and flow
- IDE Debugging Tools (Optional in PyCharm/VS Code)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- Bugs are **normal**. Every developer faces them. What matters is **how you respond** to them.
- Debugging is a **skill** — it gets better with practice, not avoidance.
- Reading errors closely often points exactly to the problem (line number, variable, file, etc.)

## 🔍 Mini Exercises:
There was no formal project today, but we went through broken programs and **fixed them step-by-step**, learning:
- Logic errors (correct syntax but incorrect behavior)
- Debugging loops, functions, and conditionals

## 💡 Debugging Philosophy:
> “Don’t panic when things break. Instead, zoom in and let the error guide you to the fix.”

No `.py` solution today — it’s all about **understanding and correcting**.
