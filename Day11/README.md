# 🃏 Day 11 – Blackjack Game

## ✅ What I Learned:
- Creating modular code using **functions**
- Simulating real-life logic (Blackjack rules) in Python
- Using **if/else**, **loops**, and **function returns**
- Managing **lists**, **randomization**, and **game state**

## 🎮 Mini Project: Blackjack Game
The classic Blackjack card game implemented in Python.

### 💡 Features:
- Deals cards randomly to the user and the computer
- Evaluates scores based on card values (including Ace logic)
- Follows rules like: dealer hits until score ≥ 17
- Declares the winner or loser based on final hands

### 📂 Files:
- `solution.py` – main logic of the Blackjack game
- `art.py` – contains the ASCII logo art (imported)

### 🔁 Replay Option:
