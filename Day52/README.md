# Day 52 – Instagram Follower Bot 🤖📸

This project is part of the [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/mumbinyanjui/100-Days-of-code-python) challenge based on Angela Yu’s Python Bootcamp.  
On Day 52, I built an **Instagram Follower Bot** using Python and Selenium.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automates Instagram login using your username and password
- ✅ Navigates to a competitor or similar account’s followers list
- ✅ Scrolls through the modal popup to load more followers
- ✅ Clicks "Follow" buttons on users
- ✅ Handles modal interruptions (e.g. Canceling “Unfollow” prompts)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Selenium WebDriver 🌐
- ChromeDriver
- XPath & CSS Selectors

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Web automation with Selenium
- Handling dynamic content (modal scrolling using JavaScript execution)
- Exception handling (`ElementClickInterceptedException`)
- Navigating complex web UIs with XPath and CSS Selectors

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
