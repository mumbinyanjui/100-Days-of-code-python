# ðŸŽ¯ Day 12 â€“ Guess the Number Game

## âœ… Concepts Covered:
- **Namespace** (global vs. local scope)
- **Function nesting**
- Variable visibility and lifetime
- Using global constants
- Handling repeated user input in functions

## ðŸŽ® Mini Project: Guess the Number
The user has to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback ("Too high", "Too low") after each guess until the correct number is guessed or the attempts run out.

### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- Difficulty selection: Easy (10 attempts), Hard (5 attempts)
- Tracks remaining attempts
- Uses functions to manage game logic cleanly
- Clear separation of scope using function definitions

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaway:
Understanding **scope and namespace** helps in writing cleaner, bug-free code. This game highlights how variable access and control flow change depending on function structure.
