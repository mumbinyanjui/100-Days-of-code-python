# Day 57 - Blog Capstone Project Part 2

## 📌 Overview
Today’s challenge was to enhance the **Blog Capstone Project** by integrating a **database** to store and manage blog posts dynamically. The goal was to move from a static, hard-coded list of blog posts to a system where posts are created, stored, and fetched from a real database.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up a database connection.
- Create a `Post` model to store blog data (title, subtitle, author, body, date).
- Fetch blog posts dynamically from the database instead of hardcoding.
- Ensure that each blog page is rendered with accurate, stored data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (web framework)
- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for database management)
- **SQLite** (lightweight database)
- **Bootstrap** (frontend styling)

## 📚 Concepts Learned
- Setting up a **Flask application** with database integration.
- Defining **SQLAlchemy models** to represent database tables.
- Querying database records to display content dynamically.
- Using Flask’s `render_template()` to pass queried data into HTML templates.
- Understanding the importance of **separation of concerns** in web development.
