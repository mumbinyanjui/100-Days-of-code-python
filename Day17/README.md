\# ðŸŽ“ Day 17 â€“ Quiz Game Project (OOP)



\## âœ… Topics Covered:

\- \*\*Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\*\* principles  

\- Creating a `Question` class to structure question data  

\- Building a `QuizBrain` class to control quiz flow: fetching questions, checking answers, and tracking score  

\- Working with lists of objects and using methods to access data  

\- Reading OOP patterns: constructors (`\_\_init\_\_`), attributes, and instance methods  



\## ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project: Quiz Game

A multiple-choice quiz console app that:

\- Loads questions and answers as `Question` objects  

\- Uses `QuizBrain` to handle user prompts, validate answers, and keep track of score  

\- Displays progress until all questions are answered



\## ðŸ§  Key Takeaway:

Practicing OOP at this stage reinforces the idea that real-world applications benefit from \*\*structured, reusable code with classes and objects\*\* â€” essential for scalable, maintainable programs.
