\# ðŸš€ Day 33: ISS Overhead Notifier



\## Overview

A script that checks if the International Space Station is overhead \*and\* whether it's currently nighttime at your location. If both conditions are met, it sends you an email alert.



\## Key Concepts

\- Fetching real-time API data (Open Notify for ISS position)

\- Parsing JSON structures

\- Comparing time zones using `datetime`

\- Using logic to detect both conditions

\- Automating alerts via SMTP email

\- Running scheduled checks with a loop and `time.sleep()`
