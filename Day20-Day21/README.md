# 🐍 Day 20–21 – Snake Game in Python



## 📌 Overview

Over two days, I built a complete Snake Game using the `turtle` module in Python. This project taught essential concepts in **game development**, **real-time animation**, and **object-oriented programming**.

## ✅ Topics Covered



### Day 20: Snake Game Part 1

- Screen setup with `turtle.Screen()`

- Using a list to manage multiple snake segments

- Moving the snake automatically in a loop

- Refreshing the screen using `screen.update()` and `time.sleep()`



### Day 21: Snake Game Part 2

- Handling user input with `onkey()` and directional control methods

- Detecting wall and self-collision using `distance()`

- Using \*\*list slicing\*\* to make snake segments follow the head

- Creating and organizing code into classes:

&nbsp; - `Snake`

&nbsp; - `Food`

&nbsp; - `Scoreboard`

## 🎮 Final Game Features

- The snake moves forward in real-time and grows when it eats food

- Users control direction with arrow keys

- The game ends on collision with a wall or with itself

- The scoreboard updates live with each point

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Learned how to build and organize real-time games in Python

- Understood the importance of class-based code for structure and maintainability

- Applied list slicing and object movement coordination

- Gained experience with `turtle` as a basic graphics library for GUI-like apps

## 🚀 What's Next?

Enhancing the game with:

- A restart option

- Sound effects or background music

- A high-score tracker using file handling
