# Day 79 â€” The Tragic Discovery of Handwashing: t-Tests & Distributions

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

On Day 79, youâ€™ll explore historical epidemiological data (the handwashing discovery) and apply statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests) and distribution analysis to draw insights. Youâ€™ll use visualizations and statistics to compare groups and understand significance.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Understanding distributions (normal, skewed)  
- Hypothesis testing: t-tests (independent, paired)  
- Null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, p-values, confidence intervals  
- Checking assumptions (normality, variance equality)  
- Data cleaning and filtering by group  
- Visual comparisons: histograms, box plots, violin plots  
- Annotating plots with statistical summary  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scipy.stats` (e.g. `ttest_ind`, `ttest_rel`)  
- `matplotlib.pyplot`  
- `seaborn`  
- (Optional) `statsmodels`
