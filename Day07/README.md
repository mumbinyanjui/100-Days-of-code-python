# Day 7 – Hangman Game 🎯

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- Python Lists and Strings
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (`for` and `while`)
- User input validation
- Basic game logic and design

## 🕹️ Mini Project: Hangman Game
The classic word guessing game – implemented in Python!
- The player has a limited number of guesses.
- Each wrong guess reduces remaining chances.
