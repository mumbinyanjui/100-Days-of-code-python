# Day 46 – Musical Time Machine: Spotify Playlist Generator

## What I Learned
- How to authenticate with the **Spotify API** using OAuth
- Fetching user-specific data and top tracks
- Creating new playlists dynamically via API calls
- Integration of **Python** with external web APIs for real-world applications

## Project: Musical Time Machine
### Features:
- OAuth-powered authentication flow with Spotify
- Fetches user’s top tracks over a selected time range
- Creates and populates a playlist with those tracks
- Allows selecting time range (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- Useful automation and a fun use of APIs and data

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding OAuth flow and token usage
- Using `requests` to interact with REST APIs (GET + POST)
- Automating end-to-end playlist creation
- Combining Python logic with third-party services for real-world utility
