\# Day 28 – Pomodoro Timer App ⏲️



Today, I built a \*\*Pomodoro Timer\*\* using Python's `tkinter` GUI library.



\## 🔍 What I Learned

\- How to use the `tkinter` library for creating GUI-based applications.

\- Timer mechanisms using `window.after()` for scheduling events.

\- Managing UI layout with `Canvas`, `Label`, `Button`, and `Grid`.

\- Implementing the \*\*Pomodoro technique\*\*: 25-minute work sessions separated by short and long breaks.

\- How to reset and control timed events effectively in Python.



\## 🧠 Concepts Applied

\- GUI design and layout with Tkinter

\- The `after()` method for creating delays

\- Countdown recursion

\- Global variables and state tracking

\- User interaction with buttons



\## 🚀 Features

\- 25-minute work sessions

\- 5-minute short breaks

\- 20-minute long breaks after 4 sessions

\- Reset functionality

\- Checkmarks to show completed sessions
