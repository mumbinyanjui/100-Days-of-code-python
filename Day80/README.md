# Day 80 â€” Capstone Project: Predict House Prices

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

On Day 80, theâ€™ll tackle a capstone project: **predicting house prices** using machine learning. The goal is to apply everything youâ€™ve learned â€” data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization â€” to build a model that predicts housing values.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering and transformation  
- Handling missing data  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Splitting data (train / validation / test)  
- Choosing models (e.g. Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)  
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, Cross-Validation)  
- Visualizing model predictions vs actual  
- Documenting results and insights  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn` (e.g. `Pipeline`, `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, model classes)  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for visualization  
- (Optional) `xgboost` or `lightgbm` or other boosting libraries  
- (Optional) `joblib` or `pickle` for model saving
