# 🧮 Day 10 – Calculator Program

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Functions with output (`return`)
- Reusable functions
- Function composition
- Storing results in variables
- Building a command-line calculator

## 🛠️ Mini Project: Calculator
This project lets users perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. It uses functions that return results, allowing the user to chain multiple operations together for an ongoing calculation.

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Functions that return values make your code modular, readable, and reusable. By returning results instead of printing them directly, we gain the flexibility to use those results in new ways.
