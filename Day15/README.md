\# ‚òï Day 15 ‚Äì Coffee Machine Program



\## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered:

\- \*\*Control flow\*\*: using `if`, `elif`, `else` statements

\- \*\*Loops\*\*: using `while` to keep the machine running

\- \*\*Functions\*\*: modular code for checking resources, processing coins, and making coffee

\- \*\*Boolean logic\*\*: to control machine state

\- \*\*User input validation\*\*

\- \*\*Arithmetic operations \& rounding\*\*



\## üéØ Project Objective:

Create a fully interactive \*\*coffee machine simulation\*\* that:

\- Accepts drink orders (espresso, latte, cappuccino)

\- Tracks and manages ingredients/resources

\- Processes coin input and handles transactions

\- Provides accurate change and profit reporting

\- Allows for turning off the machine and checking reports



\## üõ†Ô∏è Features:

\- Prompt-based user interaction

\- Resources check before processing drinks

\- Coin input and calculation:

&nbsp; - Quarters: $0.25

&nbsp; - Dimes: $0.10

&nbsp; - Nickels: $0.05

&nbsp; - Pennies: $0.01

\- Error handling:

&nbsp; - Insufficient resources

&nbsp; - Insufficient payment

\- Prints reports of available resources and profit



\## üß† Key Takeaways:

\- This project simulates a \*\*real-world process\*\* with logical conditions and modularized functionality.

\- Understanding \*\*state tracking\*\*, \*\*input handling\*\*, and \*\*resource management\*\* is crucial for building larger software systems.
