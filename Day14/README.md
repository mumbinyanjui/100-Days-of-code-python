# ðŸ“Š Day 14 â€“ Higher Lower Game

## âœ… Concepts Covered:
- Using **dictionaries** to store and access structured data
- Creating **functions** for clean, modular code
- Working with **random** data selection
- Implementing **loops** and **conditional logic**
- Tracking score using variables
- Game flow control using booleans

## ðŸŽ® Mini Project: Higher Lower Game
The game presents two public figures/accounts. The player guesses who has more social media followers.

### ðŸ’¡ Features:
- Randomly selects accounts from a dataset (`game_data`)
- Compares two accounts using follower counts
- Scorekeeping for consecutive correct answers
- Prevents comparing the same account twice
- Clean, formatted display with logo and versus art (`art.py`)

---

### ðŸ§  Key Takeaway:
Combining data, logic, and clean structure using functions creates an engaging user experience. This project enhanced my ability to manage **state**, **repetition**, and **data formatting** in Python.

ðŸ“‚ **Files:**
- `solution.py` â€“ main game logic
- `art.py` â€“ contains ASCII art for game visuals
- `game_data.py` â€“ dataset with account details (name, description, follower count, etc.)
