# Day 41 – Web Foundation: Introduction to HTML

## What I Learned
- The basic structure of an HTML document: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Importance of proper nesting and semantic tags
- Structured content using lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Embedding images with `<img>` and creating links with `<a>` tags

## Project: Personal Website (HTML only)
### Features:
- Clean HTML structure with DOCTYPE, meta charset, title, and separate head/body
- Header with personal site title and subheading
- Image section featuring a headshot or logo
- Navigation links to external profiles (e.g. GitHub, LinkedIn) and internal sections
- Informational sections laid out using paragraphs and lists

## Key Takeaways
- Building static webpages with semantic HTML
- Understanding folder/file layout for web projects
- Ready to integrate CSS and interactivity next
