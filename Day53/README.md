# Day 53 – Capstone Project: Data Entry Job Automation

## What I Learned
- Automating web interaction and form submission using **Selenium WebDriver**
- Navigating through multi-step forms and pages programmatically
- Extracting, inputting, and validating data fields
- Implementing Python loops, OOP structure, and error handling
- Simulating human-like behavior with timed delays

## Project: Data Entry Job Automation
### Features:
- Automates login and navigation on a designated job or portal site
- Iterates through entries (e.g. CSV, Google Sheets) and fills forms sequentially
- Handles form validation errors and missing elements gracefully
- Logs each submission and any exceptions during the process
- Includes configurable delays to avoid detection or rate-limiting

## Key Takeaways
- Leveraged Selenium to automate repetitive, real-world data entry tasks
- Built modular, maintainable Python code using classes and exception handling
- Learned best practices for simulating human behavior and avoiding automation detection
