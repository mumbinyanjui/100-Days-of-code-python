# Day 58 - Bootstrap Components & Responsive Design

## 📚 Overview
Today, I worked on creating a responsive, modern web page using **Bootstrap 5**.  
I explored Bootstrap's **grid system**, utility classes, and popular components to design an attractive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## 🛠 What I Learned
- Using the **Bootstrap Grid System** for layout design.
- Applying **utility classes** for spacing, colors, and typography.
- Adding components like **cards, navbars, modals, and buttons**.
- Understanding **mobile-first design principles**.
- Enhancing accessibility with Bootstrap's **semantic HTML structure**.

## 📂 Project Features
- Fully **responsive** design (mobile, tablet, desktop friendly).
- Interactive components like **modal pop-ups**.
- Organized layout using **container, row, and col** classes.
- Styled elements without writing much custom CSS.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
